name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# This workflow is kept for reference but GitHub Pages is configured to
# deploy directly from the docs/ folder on the main branch (not via Actions).
# To deploy: just push to main. GitHub Pages serves docs/ automatically.
#
# If you ever want to switch back to Actions-based deployment:
#   1. Change this file to re-enable the workflow trigger
#   2. In repo Settings > Pages, change Source to "GitHub Actions"

on:
  workflow_dispatch:   # manual trigger only — not automatic on push
