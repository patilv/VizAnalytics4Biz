## Seeing Clearly to Serve Justly {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Rooted in the Ignatian tradition, this course teaches you to transform raw data into truthful, compelling visual stories that drive ethical decision-making and serve communities. No prior coding experience required — we'll build your skills step by step.

<h4>*Cura Personalis* — Care for the Whole Person</h4>
<p>We design visualizations that respect the humanity behind every data point. Behind every number is a person, a community, a story.</p>

<h4>*Magis* — The Pursuit of Excellence</h4>
<p>We strive for the "more" — not just charts that work, but charts that illuminate. Every design choice should serve the truth.</p>

<h4>*Men and Women for Others*</h4>
<p>Data visualization is a tool for justice — from mapping air pollution to revealing healthcare disparities.</p>

<h4>Discernment through Data</h4>
<p>Visualization is a discipline of seeing — stripping away noise so the truth of the data can speak clearly.</p>
