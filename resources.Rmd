## Color Resources

Choosing the right color palette is one of the most important decisions in any visualization. These tools will help.

- [ColorBrewer 2.0](https://colorbrewer2.org/) — color palettes for maps and data viz; integrates directly with `scale_color_brewer()` in ggplot2
- [Viridis Color Palettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/) — perceptually uniform, colorblind-friendly palettes
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) — color palette generator; press spacebar to generate new schemes
- [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/) — colorblindness simulator (free desktop app)
- [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) — color blindness simulator (web-based, upload your chart image)
- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) — color wheel and palette tool with harmony rules

::: {.callout-info}
**Accessibility matters:** Approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women have some form of color vision deficiency. Always test your visualizations with a colorblindness simulator, and consider using the `viridis` palettes as a safe default.

::: {.callout-info}
**How to ask for help:** When posting a question online, always include a **minimal reproducible example** (reprex). Use the `reprex` package in R to format your code and output for easy sharing. This dramatically increases the chances of getting a helpful answer quickly.

- Anscombe, F.J. (1973). "Graphs in Statistical Analysis." *The American Statistician*, 27(1), 17--21.
  The original demonstration that summary statistics alone can be misleading — four datasets with identical means, variances, and correlations but wildly different patterns.

  Foundational empirical research on how accurately people decode visual encodings, establishing the perceptual ranking of position, length, angle, area, and color.

- Tufte, E.R. (1983, 2001). *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. Graphics Press.
  Introduced concepts like the data-ink ratio, chartjunk, the lie factor, and small multiples that remain central to visualization design.

- Wilkinson, L. (1999, 2005). *The Grammar of Graphics*. Springer.
  The theoretical framework that inspired ggplot2 — decomposing graphics into data, aesthetics, geometric objects, scales, and coordinate systems.

- Wickham, H. (2010). "A Layered Grammar of Graphics." *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, 19(1), 3--28.
  Hadley Wickham's adaptation of Wilkinson's grammar into the layered system implemented in ggplot2.

- Wickham, H. (2014). "Tidy Data." *Journal of Statistical Software*, 59(10), 1--23.
  Defines the tidy data principles (each variable a column, each observation a row, each value a cell) that underpin the entire tidyverse.

- Matejka, J. & Fitzmaurice, G. (2017). "Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing." *ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*.
  The Datasaurus Dozen — a modern extension of Anscombe's Quartet showing that even more complex summary statistics cannot substitute for visualization.

- Shneiderman, B. (1996). "The Eyes Have It: A Task by Data Type Taxonomy for Information Visualizations." *Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages*, 336--343.
  Introduced the visual information-seeking mantra: "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand."
